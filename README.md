# Endless Carcassonne
Random carcassonne map generator.

These generators already exist, but I want to give my own spin on it.
To be precise, the features listed under Goals are unique AFAIK.

# Goals
- [ ] Randomly generate tiles with the same likelihood as a real game of carcassonne.
- [ ] Allow map to be dynamically resized
